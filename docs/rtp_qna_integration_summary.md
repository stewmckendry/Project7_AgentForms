# 🧠 Return-to-Play Q&A Module – Integration Summary

## 🔹 Overview
This implementation enables natural-language Q&A around **concussion return-to-play guidance**, grounded in your official protocol (`return_to_play.yaml`) and the player’s current recovery status (`assessment_bundle`).

---

## 📁 1. `rtp_qa.py`
Contains the two main entry points for generating personalized RTP advice.

### ✅ `generate_rtp_response_rule_based(activity_name, assessment_bundle, rtp_reference) → dict`
**Purpose**:  
Matches a specific activity name (e.g., `"go for a walk"`) against protocol stages. Uses current player status to determine if the activity is allowed.

**Inputs**:
- `activity_name`: string name of the activity
- `assessment_bundle`: final responses + thoughts
- `rtp_reference`: loaded list from `return_to_play.yaml`

**Returns**:
```python
{
  "activity_match": True/False,
  "allowed": "yes" | "no" | "uncertain",
  "stage_required": "Stage 3: Sport-specific drills",
  "reason": "User is still symptomatic...",
  "recommendations": "Based on the protocol, they should wait until...",
  "citations": ["Parachute Canada (2019)"]
}
```

### ✅ `generate_rtp_response_llm(user_question, assessment_bundle, rtp_reference) → dict`
**Purpose**:  
Answers natural-language questions (e.g., “Can we skate yet?”, “What’s next?”) using the current assessment and RTP protocol as context. No hardcoded activity matching required.

**Inputs**:
- `user_question`: plain text (e.g., “Can they do gym class?”)
- `assessment_bundle`: structured status and history
- `rtp_reference`: full return-to-play stages

**Returns**:  
Same output format as above, but generated by an LLM prompt.

---

## 📁 2. `rtp_utils.py`
Supports the Q&A system with helper functions for summarizing, parsing, and stage logic.

### ✅ `find_current_stage(responses) → str`
**Purpose**:  
Infers the user’s current RTP stage using structured symptom and clearance responses.

**Returns**:  
e.g., `"stage_1"`, `"stage_3"`, or `"stage_6"` (cleared)

---

### ✅ `summarize_bundle(assessment_bundle) → str`
**Purpose**:  
Converts structured responses into a human-readable summary string for use in LLM prompts.

---

### ✅ `summarize_rtp_protocol(rtp_reference) → str`
**Purpose**:  
Formats the full RTP protocol (stage names, descriptions, allowed activities) into readable markdown-like text for LLM grounding.

---

### ✅ `parse_llm_rtp_response(response_text) → dict`
**Purpose**:  
Takes markdown output from the LLM and converts it into a structured dictionary with keys like `allowed`, `reason`, `stage_required`, etc.  
(Current version is a placeholder – can be upgraded with regex or JSON logic.)
